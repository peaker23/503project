# Object Detection Analysis with RCNN and YOLO

## Project Overview
This project aims to demonstrate and compare the capabilities of two advanced object detection models: RCNN and YOLO.

## Contents
- `Take Home Assignment - RCNN.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook is dedicated to exploring the functionality and effectiveness of the RCNN model in detecting objects within various images.
- `Take Home Assignment - YOLO.ipynb`: Similar to the RCNN notebook, this file focuses on the YOLO model, providing insights into its detection mechanisms and performance metrics.

## Installation Requirements
To ensure you can run these notebooks seamlessly, you need to install several dependencies, primarily focused around machine learning and image processing:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Libraries
The following Python libraries are required:
- TensorFlow 2.x: For running the deep learning models.
- OpenCV: For image manipulation and processing.
- NumPy: For high-performance numerical computations.

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy jupyterlab
